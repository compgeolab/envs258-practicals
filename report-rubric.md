| **Presentation**: Legibility, length, layout, use of headings | No discernible structure or organisation. Information mixed up, illogical order, completely disorganized | Many inadequacies, difficult to follow, very poor organisation and style but not totally inadequate | Poor presentation, structure and organisation require improvement, order or use of headings, layout, length, or style of figures/tables are inappropriate | Some deficiencies in style, adequate but not optimal, may require better layout, length, style of figures/tables, or use of headings | Logical presentation, appropriate length, but still requires some re-organising or editing | Logical presentation, appropriate length, very good but not necessarily at publishable quality | Organised and presented appropriately, clearly, succinctly, professionally, at a high standard with only a few minor corrections to style |
| **Visual material**: Use of figures/maps/tables, which should be labelled, captioned, and referenced in the text | No use of figures, diagrams, tables, etc. | Only or two figures/tables, no caption and not referred to in the text | Insufficient figures/tables with sloppy labelling, attribution, captioning, and referral | Insufficient figures/tables but most with proper labelling, attribution, captioning, and referral | Range of figures/tables with some significant errors in labels, etc. | Range of figures/tables, but some minor errors in labels, etc. | Appropriate and well designed figures/tables, all having labels, captions, attribution, and referred to in the text |
| **Writing**: Quality, fluency, spelling and grammar | Extremely difficult to follow, inadequate expressions/style/grammar | Very hard to follow with excessive need to rewrite, highly deficient expressions/style/grammar | Can be read and followed with difficulty, unclear style, much need to correct spelling/grammar | Can be followed okay, but some need to correct spelling/grammar, repetition of content or poor organisation of ideas/content | Well written, easy to read but some need to correct spelling/grammar, a little repetitive or obscure in places | Clear and easy to read, minimal corrections required but not necessarily of publishable quality | Very well written, no repetition, very little required to improve for professional work |
| **Referencing**: Correct, consistent referencing of appropriate range of sources | No literature awareness or sources entirely restricted to web pages. Referencing totally inadequate throughout the document, very poor paraphrasing with whole sentences or quotes used in the majority of the document | Minimal literature awareness, incomplete/incorrect referencing, highly deficient style, very weak paraphrasing with many whole sentences from sources throughout | Deficient range of sources, considerable errors and inconsistencies in style, citations are given but paraphrasing is poor in long sections of the document, references are missing when expected | Just the minimum reading required, style requires improvement, small sections of text written in own words but with missing references, poor paraphrasing in one/two places | Good evidence of reading, with a few missing references when expected, very good paraphrasing with no long phrases or whole sentences cited, style is good but requires improvement | Evidence of supplementary reading, very good style, paraphrasing very good, some corrections of citations may be required for professional-level quality | Ideal level of supplementary reading, all sources cited and references presented in correct style, written in own words with excellent summarising of sources with minimal matches in text |
| **Evidence**: Breadth, depth, and accuracy of evidence presented, knowledge of the methodology (pros/cons) |
| **Interpretation**: Evaluation of findings including level of understanding, originality, and insight |
